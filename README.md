# Creating an interactive readme in playgrounds

## Basic playground introduction

### Where is what and what is where
![run.png](run.png)

First open a new Playground in XCode 10. Now there are two ways in which you can run the playground code. 
1.  Down at the left to run the enitre playground
2. Or you can use the play button on the lines

By selecting the box you can show the result inline, so you can see the changes you make.

### The live view
If you want to see the result of ViewControllers you can set the current liveView to your viewController:
`PlaygroundPage.current.liveView = ViewController`
Dont' forget to `Import PlaygroundSupport` when you do this.

Show the assistant editor to make your live view visible

Pro-tip: When you lose your live view you can reselect it in this drop down menu by choosing Live View instead of Manual.

### Files
![add-files.png](add-files.png)

When you show the navigator you can add files to your playground

Add images to the `Resources` folder

![files.png](files.png)
Add Code files to the `Sources` folder. Don't forget to make the classes or entenstions public!

And you can use the extension in your playground code.

Pro-tip. When debugging these code files breakpoints donâ€™t get hit, so debug them by either using print statements, or just add the code to your playground page to make full use of inspection and when you are happy with it move them to a separate code file.
